# Generalized Geometric Angle Division

This interactive model demonstrates the geometric division of an arbitrary angle α into n equal parts, using parabolic and circular constructions.

Features:
- Adjustable parameters: α, n, R
- Numerical accuracy report (ε and Δ)
- Visual comparison with Thales-based approximation
